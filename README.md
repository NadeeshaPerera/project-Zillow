# project-Zillow

Hi Everyone,

I am Nadeesha, studying MS in Business Analytics at University of Texas at Dallas.
Project-Zillow is the final project that was given for the subject BUAN 6320 - Database Foundations in Fall 2017 by Professor Ravishankar Narayan.

The scope of the project is to creating a data model to fit the data (2 .csv files) provided by Zillow and creating the relevant database in mySQL (or Mongo). Then to use python to retrieve certain data from the database.
